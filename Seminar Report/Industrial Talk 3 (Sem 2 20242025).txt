Navigate to and a very good morning.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 2 minutes 56 seconds
First of all, thank you.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 2 minutes 57 seconds
Talk to you, Karim, especially to the tattica for having me today for sharing on that analytics and utilisation practise in those room, especially on the science.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 3 minutes 9 seconds
So today I would like to share the data science for public good, which is what is the career that you can consider in the AI driven Statistics Office Statistical Office or Ariel within the statistical environment, right?
NUR HUDA - DOSM 3 minutes 24 seconds
So this is the briefly see about me.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 3 minutes 27 seconds
But Madam speakers already share with you my my background and then let's let's begin.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 3 minutes 35 seconds
So I I this is just a code that every time actually we use social media every time that we shops online.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 3 minutes 42 seconds
When every time that we move around actually we are generating data, so it is, um yeah, the world produce a lots of data daily. Hourly.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 3 minutes 53 seconds
OK, so the motivation for this big data in office officials statistic already began at the year 2014, where under the United Nation Working Group on Big Data already explored the utilisation of new information sources and technology advancement for the official statistics.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 4 minutes 17 seconds
So if you can see on the right side misses of digital information is includes the GPS on the NS own National Statistical Office.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 4 minutes 27 seconds
We include the potential new statistics derived using the GPS devices, scanning devices, sensors or examples on the AIS, mobile phones, mobile positioning data, which is the controversial right now.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 4 minutes 45 seconds
And understood the lights, images and as well as the social media.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 4 minutes 49 seconds
Because when we look at this point of view, of course, this new things are required.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 4 minutes 58 seconds
New tools and methods for capturing and managing the data processing.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 5 seconds
K before that I would like to share under.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 8 seconds
You guys can can go through this and you instead big data.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 14 seconds
There is a platform that.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 18 seconds
Big data and statistical communities can share.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 23 seconds
I'm can share and participate with the I'm programme under United Nation, even at the university levels.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 31 seconds
Also, you can participate.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 33 seconds
There's several task team under this.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 36 seconds
Let me see if I can open this website.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 45 seconds
He actually can you see the website here?
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 49 seconds
Can you see the website here, Isha. No.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 5 minutes 57 seconds
Can somebody respond?
US
Umi Salim

Rushda Sinwan

Rushda Sinwan 6 minutes

ND
NUR HUDA - DOSM
6 minutes 4 seconds6:04
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 4 seconds
Ohh right.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 7 seconds
Can you share a seat now?

Rushda Sinwan
6 minutes 10 seconds6:10
Rushda Sinwan 6 minutes 10 seconds
Yes, yes, yeah.
ND
NUR HUDA - DOSM
6 minutes 11 seconds6:11
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 11 seconds
All right.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 12 seconds
OK, so if you go through the the you RL that I put under my link just now you and stats for better you or you just can Google it.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 20 seconds
So under here we have um that ohh function over there.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 25 seconds
There is a tasting which there is a previously we only have 5 Earth observation mobile positioning scanner data.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 34 seconds
Only 5 task team and right now it's already increased.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 6 minutes 37 seconds
So I do encourage that university, especially to participate in this task team because they already have they have classes depending on the time globally and you in fact can request to join their projects and even they are sharing the data for examples.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 7 minutes
I'm I'm doing this ALIAS data ALIAS data scanner is a.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 7 minutes 7 seconds
So data from um ships cargo.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 7 minutes 11 seconds
If there is a sensor inside the ships that you can monitor the ships movement for every 3 seconds davantage of this data is live data is really a micro data which you can train yourself using the the real data, not the keg data.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 7 minutes 30 seconds
So because because when when we talk about big data, the UM data acquisition and data preparation, data cleansing, data profiling sets, the most challenging part before we can move to the analytical part.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 7 minutes 44 seconds
So by using the real data that you technician allow us to participate, of course you need to fill out some form and surrender some information to access the data.
NUR HUDA - DOSM 7 minutes 55 seconds
But you really play with the real data.
